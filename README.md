## Overview

This project is a **fun and educational** experiment to dive deep into **malware development** by understanding how the **Windows kernel** and **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** mechanisms work.  
It monitors **process creation and termination**, sending details to a user-mode application through a **named pipe**.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Monitors **process creation** and **termination**
- ‚úÖ Retrieves **process image name, parent process, command line, and session ID**
- ‚úÖ Sends data to a **user-mode application** via a **named pipe**
- ‚úÖ Built **for learning and research purposes**

## Components

- **Kernel Driver** üñ•Ô∏è: Hooks into process creation and termination events.
- **User-mode Application** üì°: Reads process activity data from the named pipe.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Load the kernel driver** using a driver loader.
2. **Run the user-mode application** to start monitoring.
3. **Observe process activity** in real-time.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

It should **not be used for malicious activities**.
